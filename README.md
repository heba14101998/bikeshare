# Explore Bikeshare datasets with python
In this project, I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I wrote code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

## Tools

*	Python 3.
*	Time Library.
*	NumPy Library.
*	Pandas Library.
* Spyder IDE.
* Sublime text editor.

## DataSet

Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:
* Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
* End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
* Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
* Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
* End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
* User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
* Gender
* Birth Year
## Interactive Experience

#### Inputs
Raw input (City - Timeframe - Which month /Which day)
* The City input: Would you like to see data for Chicago, New York, or Washington?
* TimeFrame input: Would you like to filter the data by month, day, or not at all?
* Month input (If they chose month): Which month - January, February, March, April, May, or June?
* Day input (If they chose day): Which day - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday?

> Handling unexpected input such as using improper upper or lower case, Typos, and users misunderstanding what you are expecting.

#### Outputs
Interactive script that answers questions about the dataset.

### Statistics Computed

#### Popular times of travel 
(i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
* most common month
* most common day of week
* most common hour of day
#### Popular stations and trip
* most common start station
* most common end station
* most common trip from start to end 
	(i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)
#### Trip duration
* total travel time
* average travel time
#### User information
* counts of each user type
* counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
* earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
